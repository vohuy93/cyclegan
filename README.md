# cyclegan

This project aims to re-implement the model CycleGAN proposed in the paper "Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks". A variant of CycleGAN using WGAN is also given. The download_cyclegan_dataset.sh file is taken from the author's github https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN.
